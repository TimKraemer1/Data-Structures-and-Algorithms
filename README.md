## 📚 Course Overview

CSE 101 focuses on the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Topics covered include:

- Asymptotic analysis (Big-O, Big-Θ, Big-Ω)
- Recursion and divide-and-conquer strategies
- Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, MST)
- Hash tables, trees (BST, AVL), heaps, and more
- Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms

---

## 🧠 Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

- Time and space complexity analysis
- Algorithm design techniques
- Implementation of abstract data types
- Problem-solving under algorithmic constraints
- Code efficiency and correctness
